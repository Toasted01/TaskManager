Company Task Manager made 'for' Fisrt Central during University of Salfords second year 'Hack Camp'  

The purpose of the project was to further my full stack web development knowledge as well as learning how to work as a team in an agile enviroment.
This work is not entirely my own with some parts being contributed from my team, however none of them have any issues with any of us uploading this as project experience.
